# Disclaimer

These Docker Compose stacks are provided for educational and homelab purposes.

They are shared in good faith and with the intention of being helpful.  
However, they come **without any warranty**.

## No Liability

The author is not responsible for:

- services not starting
- services behaving unexpectedly
- misconfigurations
- data loss
- downtime
- security incidents
- broken alarms, missed notifications, or any indirect consequences

You are solely responsible for how you use these configurations.

## Use at Your Own Risk

Running containers involves:

- network exposure
- persistent storage
- credentials and secrets handling
- potential attack surfaces

Before deploying any stack, you should:

- review the compose file
- understand exposed ports
- verify volumes and data paths
- secure credentials
- ensure backups exist
- validate firewall rules

## Not Production-Ready by Default

These stacks are designed for homelab environments.  
They are **not** intended as hardened production infrastructure.

If you adapt them for production use, you are responsible for:

- security hardening
- monitoring
- logging
- backup strategies
- availability considerations
- compliance requirements

## Contributions & Improvements

If you find issues or have improvements, feel free to:

- open an issue
- suggest improvements
- provide better configurations

Constructive contributions are welcome.


## Final Note

Homelabs are environments for experimentation and learning.

Break things. Fix them. Improve them.

But always understand what you are running.
